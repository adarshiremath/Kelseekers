### Kelseekers
The job outlook growth in recent years has been growing constantly as per the market requirements. Specifically in the areas of those where there is a higher necessity of specialized, trained and skilled professionals. Often not all the seekers get their desired jobs based on their skills. This is a cause of concern as it might lead to a lot of indifference between the seekers. So, a Web Application could be developed so that an employment-availability or employee-availability search engine can be used in this process. This Web Application can be used by employers and employees. The Application makes use of Machine Learning(ML) and Neural Networks in order to predict whether a candidate is eligible for a given job based on a set of hyper parameters. These parameters can be their major, Grade Point Average(GPA), Co-Curricular activities and Internships. The Parameters mentioned here are relevant to a University student.

#Introduction
The IT Industry has a lot of Software Engineers but not all of them have the relevant skills. This often leads to them not securing their desired jobs. In order to secure such a job there is a requirement for improving the Job Seeker’s skill sets. In recent years the growth of Machine Learning’s predictive power is phenomenal. This technology is also used for  detecting banking fraud, recommending online advertisements, powering driverless cars, and forecasting medical diagnoses. 

#Existing System 
There are various platforms available which make use of various Machine Learning Algorithms to predict a person’s career path. These models are used to predict what career path one is most likely going to excel in. The problem with these models is that they are generalized to a large extent meaning that for a given dataset of 50,000 users, the predictions are made strictly based on the dataset as a whole. Hence, lacking personalization.

#Objectives
The main objective behind this project is to help Users(Job seekers + Employers). Job seekers will be benefited because they will identify which jobs are best suited to their skill sets and it will also help them identify what skills they will need in order to land a desired job of their liking. However, Employers will be able to easily sort through various job applications to identify which candidates are best suited for a particular job based on their technical skills, internships and GPA.

#Problem Statement
According to a study in the year 2018, India produces almost 15 lakh engineers every year. Of which not everyone lands their dream job. This can be due to numerous reasons, of which the most important reason would be lack of the right skills for a particular job. This project is designed in such a way, it helps users identify what skills are needed to land their dream job.

#Proposed System 
The Machine Learning model we plan to build will provide personalization to its users. This means to say that, every user based on their skills and interested domains are provided with a personalized prediction. This model will take into consideration various parameters depending on the employability factors and other parameters like a user’s GPA, Internships and their Major. This helps users discover their weak spots and the skills they need in order to secure their desired job.

#Methodology
In order to bring about the execution of the project, we need to identify employability signals, and store this data as the parameters we will be using in the Machine Learning Model. After which, the model needs to be built to perform predictions. Once this is done, the model needs to be validated to check the accuracy of the model. After which, the data needs to be compiled and cleansed. Finally the results produced on prediction needs to be analyzed to come to a conclusion.
System Requirement Specifications 
The software requirements needed for this project include technologies like Machine Learning, Neural Networks. A platform like Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab to build, validate  the model and make predictions too.
Applications of the Project
This project will prove to be useful not only for the Employers but also for the Students or users who wish to secure a desired job. For the Employers, it helps them decide whether a given candidate is suited for a job in terms of technical skills and can help them select potential candidates for a given job. However, this project can help candidates decide which fields they are most likely to perform well based on the parameters they enter into the system and also helps a candidate decide which skills will be required for a desired job.
